This program sends one file to a machine over a network using UDP. The receiving machine must have the server process started before starting the client. The tcpdClient and tcpdServer must be started before starting ftpc. The file will be written to a sub directory called "sub".
Troll must also be started and the port must be port 9980

To compile the server and client as well as the tcpdClient and tcpdServer use the make command


ips and ports are hardcoded for this lab
the server must be started on gamma
the client must be started on beta

troll can be started by using the command

troll 9980 -x0 -s0 (note must be on beta)

To start the server: (note must be on gamma)
	ftps 6666
	
To start the Client: (note must be on beta)
	ftpc gamma 1040 <file-to-transfer>
	
To start the tcpdClient (note must be on beta)
	tcpdClient
	
To start the tcpdServer (note must be on gamma)
	tcpdServer
	
	
	
	
the tcpdClient receives packets from the ftpc process and forwards them to the troll process
the tcpdServer receives the packets from troll and sends them to the ftps proccess
