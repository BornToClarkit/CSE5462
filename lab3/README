This program sends one file to a machine over a network using TCP. The receiving machine must have the server process started before starting the client. The file will be written to a sub directory called "sub".

To compile the server and client use the make command


To start the server:
	ftps <port-#>
	
To start the Client:
	ftpc <name-of-server> <server-port-#> <file-to-transfer>
